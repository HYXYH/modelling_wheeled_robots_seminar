    "# Project #2. Extented Kalman Filter. Localization\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is denoted to nonlinear Kalman Filter version - so called [Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter).\n",
    "\n",
    "EKF has various applications. One of them is Localization task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Localization - robot state estimation through sensor fusion and prior map knoledge. It means that robot's pose is unknown, but the map is given. Using the knoledge of control signals:\n",
    "$${u_0, ..., u_t}$$ and measurements: $$z_0, ..., z_t$$ current robot's state $x_t$ should be estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuptions:\n",
    "- feature-based map is known. Use several variants of maps\n",
    "- features are destingwishable - i.e. correspondeces are known\n",
    "- robot has a bicycle kinematics\n",
    "- robot has a mathematical model of \"absolute features sensor\". This sensor can detect and distinguish all features around the robot at range of R = 10 meters\n",
    "- robot has gps sensor. This sensor returns robot's position with some error\n",
    "- map has size of 200 by 200 meters\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow of the project:\n",
    "- Implement classes and it's methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Feature```, ```Map```, ```Feature_Sensor```, ```EKF_Localizer```, ```EKF_Experiment```\n",
    "- Use bycicle model with PID controller from [project #1](http://localhost:8888/tree/Bicycle%20model.%20PID%20controller) to make robot move along some path on the map\n",
    "- Tune up measurement noise covariance matrix\n",
    "- Tune up motion noise covariance matrix in space of $$(v, w)$$ control signals, where $v$ - linear speed and $w$ - angular speed. The kinemmatical equations of bicycle model should be improved to take $(v,w)$ as a control inputs\n",
    "- The state of the EKF filter should converge to ground truth position of the robot\n",
    "- Plot graphs and animations\n",
    "- Write small report\n",
    "- EKF state vector should have dimension of **3**: $$\\overline{x} = (x,y,\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphs to plot:\n",
    "- plot map with it's features. Print all features's id's\n",
    "- plot actual position of the robot and EKF estimation (covariance ellipsoid)\n",
    "- plot robot's trajectory\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Write little report. Give answers on the following questions:\n",
    "- Try several different maps. Are they all sutable for EKF tuning?\n",
    "- What happens if robot doesn't move and observe only one feature? Two features? Three features?\n",
    "- What further improvements can be done on EKF filter?\n",
